## Technical Challenges
The server-side code of GainzHunt is written in Node.js and uses several libraries and middleware such as Express, CORS, Body-Parser, Bcrypt, and Mongoose. Here are some of the technical challenges associated with these technologies:

- **Express**: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. One of the challenges with Express is handling errors properly and sending appropriate HTTP responses to the client.

- **CORS**: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. One of the challenges with CORS is setting up the correct headers to allow certain cross-origin requests.

- **Body-Parser**: Body-parser is a middleware that parses incoming request bodies before your handlers and is available under the `req.body` property. One of the challenges with body-parser is handling different types of request bodies such as JSON, text, raw, and URL encoded.

- **Bcrypt**: Bcrypt is a library to help you hash passwords. One of the challenges with Bcrypt is handling errors during the hashing process and ensuring the security of the hashed passwords.

- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. One of the challenges with Mongoose is handling database errors and ensuring data integrity.
